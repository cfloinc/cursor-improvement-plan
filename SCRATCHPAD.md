# Scratchpad: Agent Self-Learning Log

> **Purpose**: Track agent mistakes, user corrections, what works, what doesn't, and user preferences so the agent improves over time.
>
> **Important**: This is NOT a replacement for `AGENT.md`. `AGENT.md` is the system-of-record for hosts, secrets, services, infrastructure, and project context. The scratchpad is strictly for tracking agent learning and improvement.
>
> **Update this file at the end of every session.**

## Quick Reference (TL;DR)

> Read this first at the start of every session. Start empty; populate as sessions accumulate.

<!-- Populate with the most important current preferences and corrections -->

---

## Session Start Checklist

Run through this checklist at the beginning of each session:

- [ ] Read this scratchpad (especially Quick Reference and Active Rules)
- [ ] Read AGENT.md for current project context
- [ ] Check Active Rules — am I following them?
- [ ] Check Open Questions — anything relevant to this session?

## Session Log

> Append newest entries at the top.

<!-- Each entry format:
### Session [N] — [Date]

**Context**: [what the session was about]

**What I got wrong**: [mistakes the agent made]

**What you corrected**: [explicit corrections from the user]

**What worked**: [tools, approaches, or outputs that succeeded]

**What didn't**: [things that failed or were unhelpful]

**What you liked**: [positive feedback from the user]

**Actionable changes for next session**: [concrete takeaways]
-->

---

## Preferences and Corrections (Rolling)

> Merged, deduplicated list of recurring user preferences and corrections extracted from the session log. Keep this concise.

<!-- Populate from session log entries -->

---

## What You Like (Rolling)

> Track positive signals separately so the agent knows what behaviors to repeat.

<!-- Populate from session log entries -->

---

## Mistake Patterns (Rolling)

> Summarize recurring mistakes with pattern description, root cause, and mitigation strategy.

<!-- Format:
- **[Pattern Name]** `[freq: N] [severity: low/med/high]`
  - Root cause: [why this happens]
  - Mitigation: [how to prevent]
-->

---

## Open Questions

> Parking lot for unresolved items to watch for across sessions.

<!-- Add questions that need answers or clarification -->

---

## Learning Framework (Self-Updating)

> 5-step process for continuous improvement:

### 1. Observe
Collect concrete examples from the session log.

### 2. Classify
Tag each as one of:
- Requirement miss
- Assumption error
- Tool misuse
- Output format mismatch
- Scope overreach
- Under-communication
- Over-communication
- Other

### 3. Decide
Pick 1-3 specific, testable changes to reduce repeats.

### 4. Apply
Use the changes in the next session.

### 5. Review
Check if the changes reduced errors; revise if not.

## Active Rules (Current Period)

> The 1-3 concrete behavior rules currently in effect, decided from the framework. Review and rotate regularly. Start empty.

<!-- Format:
1. [Specific, testable rule]
2. [Specific, testable rule]
3. [Specific, testable rule]
-->
