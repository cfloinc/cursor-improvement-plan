# SCRATCHPAD -- Agent Self-Learning Log

> **Purpose**: Track agent mistakes, user corrections, what worked, what didn't,
> and user preferences so the agent improves over time.
>
> **This is NOT a replacement for AGENT.md.** AGENT.md is the system-of-record
> for hosts, secrets, services, infrastructure, and project context. The
> scratchpad is strictly for learning and behavioral improvement.
>
> **Update this file at the end of every session.**

## Quick Reference (TL;DR)

> Read this first at the start of every session. The most important current
> preferences and corrections, distilled from the session log.

*(Empty -- populate as sessions accumulate.)*

## Session Start Checklist

Run through this at the beginning of each session:

- [ ] Read this scratchpad (especially Quick Reference and Active Rules)
- [ ] Read AGENT.md for current project context
- [ ] Check Active Rules -- am I following them?
- [ ] Check Open Questions -- anything relevant to this session?

## Session Log

> Append newest entries at the top.

<!-- Template for new entries (copy this block and fill in):

### Session [N] -- YYYY-MM-DD

**Context**: What this session was about.

**What I got wrong**:
-

**What you corrected**:
-

**What worked**:
-

**What didn't**:
-

**What you liked**:
-

**Actionable changes for next session**:
-

## Preferences and Corrections (rolling)

> Merged, deduplicated list of recurring user preferences and corrections
> extracted from the session log. Keep this concise.

*(Empty -- populate from session log entries.)*

---

## What You Like (rolling)

> Positive signals tracked separately so the agent knows what behaviors to
> repeat.

*(Empty -- populate from session log entries.)*

---

## Mistake Patterns (rolling)

> Recurring mistakes summarized with frequency, severity, root cause, and
> mitigation.

*(No patterns identified yet.)*

<!-- Template for new patterns:

| Pattern | Freq | Severity | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|---------|------|----------|------------|------------|
| [description] | [N] | low/med/high | [why it happens] | [how to prevent it] |

## Open Questions

> Parking lot for unresolved items to watch for across sessions.

## Learning Framework (self-updating)

Apply this 5-step process during each scratchpad update:

1. **Observe** -- Collect concrete examples from the session log.
2. **Classify** -- Tag each as one of:
   - requirement miss
   - assumption error
   - tool misuse
   - output format mismatch
   - scope overreach
   - under-communication
   - over-communication
   - other
3. **Decide** -- Pick 1-3 specific, testable changes to reduce repeats.
4. **Apply** -- Use the changes in the next session.
5. **Review** -- Check if the changes reduced errors; revise if not.

---

## Active Rules (current period)

> The 1-3 concrete behavior rules currently in effect, decided from the
> framework above. Review and rotate regularly.

*(No active rules yet -- will be populated after first session review.)*

## Review Log

> Track each Active Rule's lifecycle.
