## Decisions

### [YYYY-MM-DD] Example: Database Selection

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Need to choose a database for the application. Expected data volume is moderate, with complex relationships between entities.

**Options Considered**:

1. **PostgreSQL**
   - Pro: ACID compliance, excellent for complex queries, JSON support
   - Pro: Strong community, well-documented
   - Con: More complex setup than SQLite

2. **MySQL**
   - Pro: Widely used, good performance
   - Con: Less feature-rich than PostgreSQL

3. **MongoDB**
   - Pro: Flexible schema, good for rapid iteration
   - Con: Not ideal for relational data, eventual consistency concerns

**Decision**: PostgreSQL

**Rationale**: Our data model has clear relationships that benefit from a relational database. PostgreSQL's JSON support gives us flexibility where needed, and its ACID compliance ensures data integrity.

**Consequences**: 
- Need PostgreSQL in development and production
- Can use advanced features like CTEs and window functions
- Team needs PostgreSQL knowledge
